# Introduction

Omeka is a free, easy to use system for creating a searchable online database of digital archival items such as images, audio, and video files. It allows you to describe the items according to academic archival standards, import and export that descriptive information from other systems, and to create as many interpretive online exhibits as you like from those items.

Think of the way a museum works: a large collection, only some of which is publicly displayed and interpreted by plaques and labels written by museum curators. Omeka works like that. 

##Sample Sites
[The City of Boston archives](https://cityofbostonarchives.omeka.net/) is an excellent example of an archive that relies on the basic functions of Omeka that we are going to explore today. The website collects and catalogues a set of items, sorts them into collections, and uses them to tell two stories in the form of digital exhibitions. 

[Colored Conventions](http://coloredconventions.org/), on the other hand, is a website that fully takes advantage of Omeka’s potential. This collaborative project aims to collect rare proceedings, newspaper coverage, and petitions from state and national political meetings of once captive Black people between 1830 and 1890. Colored Conventions is also a great example of how Omeka and digital archiving can work as pedagogical tools. It received awards from the MLA, ASA, and PCA/ACA along with grants from the NEH, Mellon Foundation, and CLI.
##Omeka VS Omeka.net
Omeka is NOT desktop software that you install on your own machine, it’s what’s called “server-side software.” There are two ways to use Omeka: you can download a free, open-source version of the server-side software at omeka.org, or, if you don’t have server space or would just rather not deal with it, you can sign up for free or paid “hosted” versions at [Omeka.net](http://omeka.net). 

For practical purposes, we will make use of the latter during this workshop. But rest assured that despite having a limited set of functionalities, Omeka.net operates in the same way as the self-hosted version.  

##Today’s Exercise
Throughout this workshop, we are going to create and populate a database with artifacts from Altman’s & Co., the department store that until January 1990 resided in the building that now houses the Graduate Center. We are then going to create a sample exhibition that uses the items in our collections to tell the story of the store in the first two decades of the 1900s.
