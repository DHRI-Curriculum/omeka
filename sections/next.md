# Next Steps

## DARC! 
The Digital Fellows are currently developing a platform that aims to address the needs of students, faculty, and communities working on Archival Research at the Graduate Center. While our primary goal is to assist in the creation of digital archives and exhibitions, we also aim to provide resources (in the form of tutorials, best practices, and workshops) on the archival research process itself. We foster community building among digital archivists and researchers at the Graduate Center, by promoting projects and facilitating communication across disciplines and institutional settings.
