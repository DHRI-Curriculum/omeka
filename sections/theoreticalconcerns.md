# Theoretical Concerns

Before we engage with the creation of our Omeka database, let’s take a few minutes to think about the conceptual concerns that we have to face when engaging with digital archival work. 

We encourage you to discuss these short and long term concerns with our librarians and archivists in your field. It is often crucial to tackle and think through these issues before you start working on your project, as they might influence the shape of the technological infrastructure you are developing. 

1. Metadata standards
Metadata includes the documentation of data architecture, properties, and methods necessary to store, retrieve, and use the data in a meaningful manner. In other words, it is data about data, or information about an item. For example, bibliographic metadata is the title, author, publisher, date and so on of a publication. Different fields and different objects require different metadata  standards. Omeka encourages you to describe every item with lots of metadata, which is part of what makes it a scholarly system. By default, Omeka relies on Dublin Core, a metadata standard used by libraries and archives for digital items that consists of 15 basic fields that can be used to describe any digital object, no matter what it is. Such basic fields include Creator, Subject, Description, Date, Rights, and so on. 

Example: http://coloredconventions.org/items/show/278 

Omeka does also allow adding additional standard metadata fields and creating custom metadata fields, but this may make it more difficult to transfer your data to and from Omeka and other systems, since these systems need a shared vocabulary to “talk” to one another. The fact that Omeka is built on Dublin Core means that your data is likelier to last longer, because it can be moved to other systems later. There are prompts built in to Omeka that will help you understand what information to put in every Dublin Core field, but you can also consult the [Dublin Core User Guide section on Creating Metadata](https://github.com/dcmi/repository/blob/master/mediawiki_wiki/User_Guide.md).

Keep in mind that you should be as consistent as possible in your metadata. For example, if you use “New York, NY” in the “Coverage” field, make sure you follow the same City, State format when compiling the same field for other items.
